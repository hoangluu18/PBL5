The new iMac delivers tremendous performance in an 11.5-millimeter-thin design with a stunning side profile that almost vanishes. iMac includes a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display with 11.3 million pixels, 500 nits of brightness, and over a billion colors, giving a beautiful and vivid viewing experience. It is available in a variety of striking colors to match a user's own style and brighten any area. A 1080p FaceTime HD camera, studio-quality mics, and a six-speaker sound system are all included in the new iMac, making it the greatest camera and audio system ever in a Mac. Touch ID is also making its debut on the iMac, making it easier than ever to securely log in, make Apple Pay transactions, and switch user accounts with the touch of a finger. Apps launch at lightning speed, everyday chores seem astonishingly fast and fluid, and demanding workloads like editing 4K video and working with large photos are faster than ever before thanks to the power and performance of M1 and macOS Big Sur.</div>
